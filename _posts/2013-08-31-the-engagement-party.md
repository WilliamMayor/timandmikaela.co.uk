# The Engagement Party

## {{ page.date | date_to_string }}

It was a wonderful night celebrating our engagement with family and friends. We were very lucky to have the night organised and prepared by Babs with plentiful amounts of food, drink, music and fun. We received a variety of delightful and thoughtful cards and gifts which we are very thankful for and will keep for a lifetime.
