# The Proposal
## {{ page.date | date_to_string }}

It all took place on our holiday to Cala Millor in Majorca. On the second day after a fantastic day of poolside fun and relaxing, we got ready for an evening by the sea front. After a delicious meal and cocktails we took a moonlit stroll just before midnight on the beach, where we found a place to sit down and admire the view. This was where the proposal happened and of course the response was one of exhilaration and joy. A day to remember for the rest of our lives.
