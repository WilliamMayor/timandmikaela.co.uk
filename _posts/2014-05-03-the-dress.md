# Finding my Wedding Dress

## {{ page.date | date_to_string }}

It really was the fairy tale adventure that I thought that it would be. Going to different shops, being welcomed in and treated like a Princess. It was as fun finding and trying on dresses that I hated as well as ones that I loved.  There were lots of dresses that I liked but none of them felt like 'The One'. Did it even exist?

Then on the 17th April it happened.

It all started the same as usual, going through the motions of selecting dresses and then taking them to the changing room. They all looked lovely on but they weren't right for me. I went back behind the curtains to try on the next dress and then walked out expecting to feel the same emptiness as before.

As soon as I looked in the mirror I knew that this was the dress that I was going to be married in. I felt an instant connection and emotion that is impossible to properly describe. I had finally found it; I had found the dress that I would become Mrs Woodgates in.

To be 100% sure, I did see other dresses after. Nothing compared, not even close. So on the 3rd May I returned to see and try on my dream dress again. I was right; it was definitely 'The One'. I imagined myself walking down the aisle, saying my vows, dancing our first dance. There wasn't a doubt left in my mind.

So now I have to wait until September for my dress to be made, but it is worth waiting for.
