Could we please have a page that has information about the venue (Crockwell Farm).  Here is a link: http://www.crockwellfarm.co.uk/ for you to pick out some photos and info.
Could there also be space for a possible timetable of the day please?  We don’t know ourselves yet, but would be cool to have this info up there.
Can you include a RSVP online for all day/evening guests please?
Could we please also have a page for a gift list potentially?!
Would you also be able to have a page that links to local accommodation please?  I will put together a list of websites and send this over later.
Can you have a space that enables people to get directions to the venue please? – I don't know whether we can hack into Google Maps or something, lol.
Could we possibly incorporate a “wedding blog” please?
Could we also please have an online guest book?
Could you also create a photo gallery page? There are some photos attached for your enjoyment!
